WIP currently

A graphic vertical timeline of hiking events me and my friends have been on.

Create an account, create a timeline event, and upload images to said event for everyone to see and add their own images too.

Custom backend for authentication using jwt, database by MongoDB for users and timeline events, firebase storage for images, Material-UI for the UI.
